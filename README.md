# Oxystyl
Oxystyl is a fast compiler for Stylus CSS implemented in Rust. It uses Logos for tokenization and LALRPOP for parsing, ensuring a clear separation between lexing and parsing phases. The lexer focuses solely on token extraction, delegating high-level semantic processing (like functions or mixins) to the parser.

## Features

- High performance: Built with Rust and a strict separation of concerns.
- Modularity: The lexer extracts only tokens without handling high-level logic.
- Compatibility: Supports most tokens and regex patterns from the original Stylus CSS compiler:
  - Literals and special sequences (strings, numbers with units, colors, Unicode, etc.).
  - Arithmetic and logical operators, delimiters, and grouping symbols.
  - Handling of comments, spaces, newlines, and carriage returns.
  - Specific tokens for Stylus constructs such as \@import, \@css literals, and anonymous functions.
- Flexible grammar: Includes definitions for non-terminal symbols while keeping lexing and parsing logic separate.

## Project Structure

- **lexer.rs**: Contains token definitions using Logos. This file defines regular expressions for each tokenâ€”from primitive values to operators, literals, and Stylus-specific constructs.
- **parser.rs**: Uses LALRPOP to build the abstract syntax tree (AST) from the tokens produced.
- **main.rs**: Demonstrates example usage, iterating over input to generate tokens.

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (latest stable version recommended)
- Cargo for dependency management

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Oxystyl.git
   cd Oxystyl
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Usage

After building, you can run the compiler by providing a Stylus file as input:

```bash
cargo run --release -- path/to/your_file.styl
```

The compiler processes the input, generating tokens while deferring semantic interpretation to the parsing phase.
